### Home_Credit_Default_Risk

#### **Project Goal:** 
The goal of the Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle project is to develop predictive models that accurately assess the credit default risk of loan applicants. Specifically, the project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan, with the broader objective of improving responsible lending practices and financial inclusion for individuals with limited or no credit history.
Business Problems:

**Credit Risk Assessment:** Home Credit Group faces the challenge of evaluating the creditworthiness of loan applicants who may not have a traditional credit history. Accurate assessment of credit risk is crucial to minimize loan defaults and associated financial losses.

**Financial Inclusion:** The project seeks to address the problem of financial exclusion by providing loans to individuals who are often underserved by traditional lenders. It aims to offer a positive borrowing experience to those with limited access to credit.
